In C# program will start from the Main() which is the entry point of your project

class and the object

what is class ? 
    It is a blue print og your program structre
what is object ? 
    Object is a real time entity( has some existence(like its own properties and behavious(action or methods)))

what is method ? 
    Method is some set of statements or instructions

for eg. 
    public void Display() {
        int a = 10;
        Console.WriteLine("Display MEthod called")
    }

<!-- Class 1 -->
class Student {
    public void Display() {
        Console.WriteLine("Printing)
    }
}

<!-- Now we call Method of another calss in asome other class -->
class Program {
    static void Main(){
        <!-- class reference variable is pointing to an object -->
        Student s = new Student();
        s.Display();
    }
}

BCL (Base Class Library): Core Libraries

The BCL provides fundamental classes for basic operations such as collections, file I/O, threading, data types, and more. Examples include System.String, System.Collections.Generic.List<T>, System.IO.File, and System.Threading.Thread.

System
System.Collections
System.IO
System.Threading

CLR: 
JIT Compilation
Garbage Collection
Exceptions Handling
Security
Thread Management


All user-defined classes in C#, such as Employee and Program, are implicitly inherited from the System.Object class. This means they get basic methods like ToString(), Equals(), GetHashCode(), and GetType() by default.
